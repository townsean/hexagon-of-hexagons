# hexagon-of-hexagons
Generate a SVG of a hexagon comprised of smaller hexagons. See it in action [here](http://townsean.github.io/hexagon-of-hexagons/)! (work in progress)

## Synopsis
Hexagon of Hexagons is a vanilla JS web app that generates a SVG of a hexagon comprised of smaller hexagons given an input x, where x equals the length of a side. 

## Motivation
I wanted to create a custom tray for the greatest board game of all time: Twilight Imperium. The game uses hexagon planet tiles. The game board is the collection of these planet tiles. Together the tiles form a larger hexagon. My plan is to use my CNC machine to carve out hexagons such that the planet tiles can fit into the carved out sections making the game board portable. 

I thought it would be great to programmatically generate the SVG file necessary for carving the custom tray for Twilight Imperium. This wheel probably has already been invented before (I haven't looked), but regardless I thought it would be a fun project to implement.

Additionally, I have been craving writing a web app in vanilla JS and CSS. This projects provides me the opportunity to do so. I have been spoiled by frontend frameworks and feel working on this project will be a great opportunity to further expand my knowledge base.
